## Inspiration

Jackbox party pack games
## What it does

Nautical Necessities guides users in answering the age-old question: "If you were stranded on a desert island, what would you bring?" Using OpenAI's ChatGPT, the game keeps asking funny follow-up questions to each user - the funniest item wins!
## How we built it

We used Next.js as the front and backend framework, along with Supabase's realtime databases for realtime game functionality. We used Langchain as a wrapper for OpenAI's ChatGPT as well. We deployed to Vercel.
## Challenges we ran into

Making a real-time game was not something either of us had experience with and with how to do well. We had to come up with a game code system, and a game loop that remains synchronized with the client and server. It wasn't easy, and there are still some bugs, but it's a living!
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning Supabase real-time databases was a proud achievement, and how to do a real-time game flow.
